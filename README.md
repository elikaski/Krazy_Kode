# **Krazy Kode**
A collection of funny concepts of writing code that works but is hard for humans to understand

## Presentation
All of the material is available in the PowerPoint presentation - Krazy Kode.pptx,
which contains detailed explanations for every example

### Examples
Some of the examples introduced are:
* Using regular expression to determine if a number is prime
* Implementing "main" as an int array instead of as a function
* Hiding Python code in the documentation
* Creating universal code that implements every program ever written
* Computing Pi using creative visual macros

And more...

## Demos
The examples files from the presentation are available in the "demos" directory
